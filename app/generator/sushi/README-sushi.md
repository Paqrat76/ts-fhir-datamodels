FHIR Shorthand (FSH) is a domain-specific language for defining HL7® FHIR® artifacts involved in creation of
FHIR Implementation Guides (IG).
Specifically, this project provides several FSH (`*.fsh`) files use to create FHIR `StructureDefinition`s for
custom FHIR resources used for comprehensive functional testing.
Refer to [README-Functional-Testing](../../generator-datamodel-ftest/README-Functional-Testing.md).
